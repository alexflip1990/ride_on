RESPONSIVE IMAGE GOES HERE

 ## Introduction
   
RIDE-ON is a comprehensive e-commerce platform created using Django, Python, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The website integrates Stripe as its payment gateway.

This rendition is designed for Project 5 of the Code Institute Diploma in Software Development and does not process actual payments. Therefore, any orders placed will not be completed.

To explore the payment feature, you can use the following card details when prompted:

-   Card number: 4242 4242 4242 4242
-   Expiry date: any future date (e.g., 11/26)
-   CVC: any 3 digits (e.g., 123)

## Layout

### Design
- The colour theme for Ride-on consists mainly of black and white with the acceptation of the background image on the homepage. I have chosen to keep the design of the site simple, this is not overwhelm the user when they visit the site giving a good user experience.

### Typography
- Standard bootstrap theme for all the components and styling was used. Kanit and San-Serif are the fonts used for the site, font colour is a mixture of white, blue grey and black, upon a black background the font is white with some areas blue to make the font easier to read against the dark background. Upon a white background the font is black and grey, this gives a nice contrast making the font clear to read.

###  Images
- Background image was chosen to go with the websites theme. I have chosen a male riding a bike with the background colours blurred giving the impression that the cyclist is moving across the screen.

## Wireframes
The wireframes where created using balsamiq

##  Model Structure
The model databases where designed using lucid chart.

## Marketing
### E-commerce Business Model
Ride-On is a B2C (business to customer) model, selling a variety of bicycles directly to the customer. The customer is able to make a quick purchase without registration to the site for checkout.  The business is promoted on Facebook, where an authentic site can rapidly attract attention and build a customer base in the real world. Ride-On targets individuals who are passionate about cycling, including enthusiasts, commuters, and recreational riders. The bicycles cater to a wide range of preferences, including road bikes, mountain bikes, and standard bikes. The target audience values quality, reliability, and affordability in their bicycle purchases. The website features a user-friendly and intuitive design, ensuring a seamless user experience. Users can easily sign up for the newsletter and reach out via the website for inquiries. Additionally, the platform showcases announcements for upcoming events hosted by the site, encouraging community engagement and participation.

### Facebook marketing 
This site is connected to Facebook where a business page was created. The Facebook link on the site is not guaranteed to work when the project is reviewed, this is because Facebook has a tendency to remove business pages it deems not to be real, however below is a image of the Facebook page created as proof this task was carried out. 

FACEBOOK IMAGE GOES HERE

Additional marketing strategies for Ride-On will involve sending newsletters to new subscribers immediately upon joining, offering competitive prices to incentivize purchases, hosting cycling events, and continuously upgrading and maintaining excellence to remain competitive as the business expands.

### SEO
The project includes descriptive meta tags in base.html head, sitemap.xml, and robots.txt to enhance SEO optimization. For better SEO, all of the bikes added have normal and descriptive names instead of num/char combinations, for example:
"Green front suspension mountain bike"
Here is a list of some of the selected key words for the meta tags located in the base.html

- bike
- mountain
- road
- comfort
- front suspension
- full suspension
- standard
- fatbike
- lightweight
- carbon fiber 

## User Stories
This project was brought to life using Agile Methodology in Github, the user stories were created using issues. Each story describes what needs to be done and is broken down into acceptance criteria and tasks, and prioritized using GitHub labels with various colours and separated into milestones.

5 epics where created which resulted in a total of 29 user stories. Each story was marked with a classification of Must-Have, Should-Have or Could-Have, and each story was also given a story-point. These points inform roughly how much time/difficulty it takes to complete each story.

## Deployment
  
This project is deployed on Heroku for production, with all static and media files stored on AWS S3. Here are the steps for deployment on Heroku:

  
1. Go to Heroku.com, either create a new account or log in if you already have one. Once logged in, on the dashboard page, click the "Create New App" button. Provide a unique name for the app, ensuring hyphens are used between words. Choose the region closest to you, then click "Create App".

2. In the "Resources" tab, set up a new Heroku Postgres database.
3. Configure variables on Heroku by going to Settings and clicking on "Reveal Config Vars." Add the necessary variables as you proceed with the deployment process.


| Variables  | Keys |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID  | your_access_key_id_from_AWS  |
| AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY  | your_secret_access_key_from_AWS  |
| DATABASE_URL  | your_database_url  |
| EMAIL_HOST_PASS  | your_app_password_from_your_email  |
| EMAIL_HOST_USER  | your_email_address  |
| SECRET_KEY  | your_secret_key  |
| STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY  | your_stripe_public_key  |
| STRIPE_SECRET_KEY  | your_stripe_secret_key  |
| USE_AWS  | True  |

4. If you haven't installed them yet, install dj_database_url and psycopg2.
```
pip3 install dj_database_url==0.5.0 psycopg2
```
5. Update your requirements.txt file to include the newly installed packages.
```
 pip freeze > requirements.txt
```
6.  In your settings.py file, import dj_database_url below the import statement for os.
```
 import os
 import dj_database_url
```
7. Scroll to the DATABASES section and update it with the following code. Comment out the original connection to sqlite3 and connect to the new ElephantSQL database instead. Paste your ElephantSQL database URL where indicated.
```
 # DATABASES = {
 #     'default': {
 #         'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
 #         'NAME': os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'db.sqlite3'),
 #     }
 # }
     
 DATABASES = {
     'default': dj_database_url.parse('your-database-url-here')
 }
    
```
**DO NOT commit** this file with your database string in the code, this is temporary so that we can connect to the new database and make migrations. We will remove it in a moment.

8. In the terminal, execute the showmigrations command to verify that you are connected to the external database.
```
 python3 manage.py showmigrations
```

9. If successful, you should see a list of all migrations, with none of them marked as completed.
10.  Migrate your database models to the new database by running the migration commands. 
```
 python3 manage.py migrate
```
11. Load the fixtures into the database. Ensure that you load the categories first, as the order is crucial.
```
python3 manage.py loaddata categories
```
12. Next, load the products into the database. Ensure that you load the products after the categories, as the products require a category to be set.
```
 python3 manage.py loaddata products
```
13. Generate a superuser account for your new database by running the createsuperuser command in the terminal.
```
python3 manage.py createsuperuser
```
14. To ensure that our database credentials are not exposed when pushing to GitHub, remove the database configuration from the settings.py file and revert back to using the local SQLite database. Here's how your DATABASES setting should look like temporarily
```
 DATABASES = {
     'default': {
         'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
         'NAME': os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'db.sqlite3'),
     }
 }
```
15. Navigate to your database's ElephantSQL page and select "BROWSER" from the left-side navigation menu.
16. Click the **Table queries** button, select **auth_user**
17. Then click "Execute," you should see the details of your newly created superuser displayed. This confirms that your tables have been created and you can now add data to your database.
18. Now in settings.py, we're implementing an if/else statement to utilize the development database during development and the external database for the live site. Note the change where the database URL becomes a variable for Heroku.
```
 if 'DATABASE_URL' in os.environ:
    DATABASES = {
       'default': dj_database_url.parse(os.environ.get('DATABASE_URL'))
    }
 else:
    DATABASES = {
       'default': {
           'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
           'NAME': os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'db.sqlite3')
        }
    }
```
19. Install gunicorn, which serves as our web server, and add it to the requirements.txt file.
```
pip3 install gunicorn pip3 freeze > requirements.txt
```

  
20. Generate a Procfile in the project's root directory. This tells Heroku to create a web dyno that executes gunicorn and hosts our Django application. Populate the file with the following content (ensuring there are no blank lines below)
```
web: gunicorn seaside_sewing.wsgi:application
```
21. In your terminal, while using the Heroku Command Line Interface (CLI), run the following command to turn off the collectstatic option. This ensures that Heroku doesn't collect static files during deployment
```
heroku config:set DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC=1 --app heroku-app-name-here
```
22. We must now include the Heroku app and localhost (to keep GitPod functional) in the ALLOWED_HOSTS = [] list in settings.py:
```
 ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['{heroku deployed site URL here}', 'localhost' ]
```
23. Save your changes, add, commit, and push them to GitHub. Additionally, initialize the Heroku git remote in the terminal and push to Heroku with
```
heroku git:remote -a {app name here} git push heroku main
```
24. Now, you should be able to view the deployed site (without any static files, as we haven't set these up yet).
25. To enable automatic deploys on Heroku, go to the "Deploy" tab and click the "Connect to GitHub" button in the deployment method section. Search for the project's repository and then click "Connect." Finally, click "Enable Automatic Deploys" at the bottom of the page.

### Creating AWS Bucket
All static and media files in this project are stored in an Amazon Web Services (AWS) S3 bucket, which is a cloud-based storage service. To create your own bucket, follow these steps:

1. Go to Amazon Web Service website and click on Create An AWS Account, or login if you already have an account.
2. After logging in to your new account, navigate to the AWS Management Console and locate the S3 service. Click on "Create Bucket" to begin the process.
3. Choose a name for your bucket (it's recommended to use the same name as your Heroku app) and select the region closest to your location.
4. In the "Object Ownership" section, select "ACLs enabled" and "Bucket Owner Preferred".
5. Uncheck box 'Block All Public Access'.
6. Checkbox 'I acknowledge that the current settings might result in this bucket and the objects within becoming public.'
7. Click on "Create Bucket," and your bucket will be created.
8.   Navigate to your newly created bucket, then go to the "Properties" tab. Scroll down until you find "Static Website Hosting," and click on "Edit" to enable , Hosting type: choose Host a Static Website, Index document: index.html, Error document: error.html and save changes.
9. Go to the "Permissions" tab, and scroll down to the "Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS)" section. Click on "Edit," then paste the provided CORS Configuration below to establish the necessary access between the Heroku app and the S3 bucket. Finally, click on "Save Changes."
``` 
[
  {
      "AllowedHeaders": [
          "Authorization"
      ],
      "AllowedMethods": [
          "GET"
      ],
      "AllowedOrigins": [
          "*"
      ],
      "ExposeHeaders": []
  }
] 
```
10. While on the "Permissions" tab, locate the "Bucket policy" section, click on "Edit," and proceed to the Policy Generator.
```
* Select Type of Policy: choose S3 Bucket Policy

* Effect: choose Allow
 
* Principal: *
 
* Actions: select GetObject
 
* Fill in the Amazon Resource Name (ARN), from the Bucket ARN back in the Bucket Policy
 
* Click on "Add Statement," then "Generate Policy." Copy the policy generated and paste it into the bucket policy editor.
 
* Add a "/*" to the end of the resource key to allow access to all resources in this bucket. Then click Save. The resource key should look like this: 

     "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::YOUR_BUCKET_NAME/*", 

On the Permissions tab, navigate to the Access Control List (ACL) section. Click Edit and enable List for Everyone (public access), then accept the warning box.
```
11. Now that the bucket is set up, we need to create a user to access it through another service called IAM (Identity and Access Management). Return to the service menu and open IAM.
12. Next, let's create a group for our user to reside in. Click on "User Groups" and create a new group with a name of your choice. For instance, I named the group "manage-ride-on". Once done, scroll to the bottom and click "Create Group".
13. Now, let's create an access policy granting the group access to the S3 bucket that has been created.
14. Next, click on "Policy", followed by "Create Policy". Navigate to the JSON tab, and select "import managed policy". This option allows us to import a pre-built policy from AWS. Search for S3, then import the "AmazonS3FullAccess" policy.
15. We only want to grant full access to our new bucket and its contents, paste the bucket ARN (which can be found on the bucket policy page in S3) into the JSON editor.
```
"Resource": [ "arn:aws:s3:::YOUR_BUCKET_NAME", "arn:aws:s3:::YOUR_BUCKET_NAME/*" ]
```
16. Now click on Next:Tags, then click Next:Review.
17. Give the review policy a name and a description, then click Create Policy. The policy has now been successfully created.
18. Lastly, assign the user to the group so it can utilize the policy to access all our files.
19. Go to User Groups, select the group, then navigate to the Permissions tab. Open the Add Permissions dropdown and click on Attach Policies.
20. Select the policy and click on Add permissions at the bottom.
21. Proceed to the Users page, then click on Add Users to create a user to be added to the group.
22. Set a username for the user, select "Programmatic access" for access type, and then proceed to the next step by clicking "Next: Permissions".
23. Select the group with the attached policy, proceed to the next step by clicking "Next: Tags", then "Next: Review", and finally create the user.
24. Download the csv file and save it.

###  Connect Django to AWS Bucket
  
Here are the steps I followed to connect Django to AWS:
1. Now install two new packages and freeze them into the requirements.txt
```
pip3 install boto3
pip3 install django-storages
pip3 freeze > requirements.txt
```
2. Add storages to the Installed Apps in settings.py.
3. To set cache control, bucket configurations, static and media files location, and override static and media URLs in production in settings.py, you can use the following:
```
 if 'USE_AWS' in os.environ:
     # Cache control
     AWS_S3_OBJECT_PARAMETERS = {
         'Expires': 'Thu, 31 Dec 2099 20:00:00 GMT',
         'CacheControl': 'max-age=94608000',
     }

     # Bucket Config
     AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME = 'YOUR_BUCKET_NAME'
     AWS_S3_REGION_NAME = 'YOUR_REGION'
     AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID = os.environ.get('AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID')
     AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = os.environ.get('AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY')
     AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN = f'{AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME}.s3.amazonaws.com'

     # Static and media files
     STATICFILES_STORAGE = 'custom_storages.StaticStorage'
     STATICFILES_LOCATION = 'static'
     DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE = 'custom_storages.MediaStorage'
     MEDIAFILES_LOCATION = 'media' 

     # Override static and media URLs in production
     STATIC_URL = f'https://{AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN}/{STATICFILES_LOCATION}/'
     MEDIA_URL = f'https://{AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN}/{MEDIAFILES_LOCATION}/'
```
4. To set the Config Vars on Heroku, follow these steps:
- Go to your app's dashboard on Heroku.
- Navigate to the Settings tab.
- Click on the "Reveal Config Vars" button.
- Set the following variables:


| Variables  | Keys |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID  | Your access key ID obtained from the previously downloaded CSV file.  |
| AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY  | Your secret access key obtained from the previously downloaded CSV file.  |
| USE_AWS  | True  |

5. Delete the COLLECTSTATIC variable from the Config Vars.
6. We need to inform Django to utilize S3 for storing our static files during collectstatic and to send uploaded images there as well in production. To do this, create a custom_storages.py file in the root directory of your project and specify the Static and Media Storage locations within it.
```
from django.conf import settings
from storages.backends.s3boto3 import S3Boto3Storage


class StaticStorage(S3Boto3Storage):
   location = settings.STATICFILES_LOCATION


class MediaStorage(S3Boto3Storage):
   location = settings.MEDIAFILES_LOCATION
```
7. Now push these changes on github
```
git add .
git commit -m "Your commit message"
git push
```

## Further testing
 - Ride-On has been tested on Google-Chrome, FireFox and Microsoft Edge and works fine.
  - The website has been tested on a number on different screens including Iphone XR, Samsung Galaxy S20 and Nest Hub Max, it is responsive and works on all devices.
  - Friends have been asked to review the site for any bugs or issues as a user experience.

## Bugs
- Solved bugs
- HOMEPAGE ERRORS GOES HERE
PROFILE ERRORS GOES HERE
PRIVACY ERRORS GOES HERE
T & C ERRORS GOES HERE
PRODUCT ERRORS GOES HERE
ADD PRODUCT ERRORS GOES HERE
BASKET ERRORS GOES HERE

## Unfixed bugs
- This is a duplicate attribute error located within {%%} tags on the add products page, due to time constraints I have not been able to resolve this issue yet but will look to fix this issue in the future, it does not effect the overall performance of the site.
  ADD PRODUCT ERROR 2 GOES HERE

- I had to add the quantity_input_script.html code into the postload js block for incrementing/decrementing the products amount as for some reason it was not recognising the file path, I was advised by John from tutor support to do this as a workaround as he reviewed the code and could not see why it wasn't working. I had created the necessary files to put the code in and used the correct file path but it would not work. This may have been a bug with codeanywhere which was the original platform I used before switching to gitpod towards the end of my project due to consistent issues with codeanywhere. Having the code in the postload js block allows it to work correctly however this may affect the performance of the site with lighthouse.

To my knowledge there are no further unresolved bugs, that does not mean they do not exist, any further bugs discovered I will look to rectify in the near future.

## Credits

- I used the walkthrough project from Boutique Ado from Code Institute as a base for my project to set up the e/commerce online store.
  - [Shines School Supply](https://shine-school-supplies.herokuapp.com/) was referenced for inspiration
  - My friend Paul advised me on how to create a function to prevent regular users from accessing a particular url when the regular "if  not request.user.is_superuser:" or "@user_passes_test(lambda  u: u.is_superuser, login_url='/')" would not work.
  - [FREEP!K](https://www.freepik.com/) - To download all product images. 


## Acknowledgements
 - I would like to thank Jason from tutor support for advising to create a subcategory model and add items into the subcategory.
 - I would like to thank all the tutors at tutor support for their advice throughout this project and helping me migrate my project over to gitpod from codeanywhere when I was experiencing constant issues.
 - I would like to thank Code Institute for granting me an extension on the deadline from experiencing so many issues with codeanywhere. 
 - I would like to thank my tutor Lauren for all the support she has given me during this module. I found it very difficult at times to focus with juggling a mixture of day/night 12 hr shifts.
 - I would like to thank my friends Paul and Dylan and other friends with helping test my project as a user experience by registering to the website as users and giving me honest feedback on what they thought.
 - I would like to thank my family for their support, I experienced a major set back a week before the deadline which almost made me give up, some tuff love and encouragement put me back on track to finish.
